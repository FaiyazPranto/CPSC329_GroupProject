Which of the following does not use cryptography in some way?,Protecting unencrypted files against malware attacks,Encrypting the SIM card used in a mobile phone, Encrypting and hashing a password table,Sending encrypted information over a network to another user,Protecting unencrypted files against malware attacks,Unencrypted files do not use cryptography. As the file is stored in plaintext it has not been encoded in any way- thus cryptography is not involved. All the other answers involve encryption and cryptography in some way.
What are the origins of the word “Cryptography”?,The word is based of a phrase coined in the journal of Alan Turing,The word originated in modern English and it has no basis in historical languages,The word is based off the Ancient Greek kryptós and graphein,The word is based off of a Latin phrase which has since become untranslatable,The word is based off the Ancient Greek kryptós and graphein,While it would be interesting to see the word originate in modern English or as a phrase coined by a famous computer scientist the origins of the word cryptography are based in Ancient Greek. It is a concatenation of kryptós and graphein
Which element of a system should be a secret?,The algorithm should be kept secret to ensure that the data it is protecting is not accessed by an unauthorised third party,The cryptography key should be kept a secret,The identity of the sender should be kept a secret to ensure anonymity,The identity of the receiver should be kept a secret to ensure their key does not get accessed,The cryptography key should be kept a secret,Ultimately the identity of the sender and receiver are irrelevant to an encryption algorithm. Encryption algorithms are usually public as the cryptography key should be unique and private so the message is impossible to decrypt by an unauthorised recipient
What is the difference between plaintext and ciphertext?,There is no difference between plaintext and ciphertext they are simply different words for the same thing,Plaintext is an encrypted message and ciphertext is the key used to decode the plaintext,Plaintext is a gibberish message generated by an algorithm contained in the ciphertext message,Plaintext is the original readable message and ciphertext is the unreadable encrypted message,Plaintext is the original readable message and ciphertext is the unreadable encrypted message,As can be reasoned out with a bit of thinking plaintext is the original form of a message and ciphertext is the encrypted (and thus unreadable) message.
